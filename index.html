        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have a bachelor's in Mathematics and a minor in computer science and have just started my second semester
            in an online Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I am a fast learner and have a large drive to gain
            new skills and knowledge. In my undergraduate studies I was involved in two high level physics experiments
            on which I contributed greatly. This included data analysis and manipulation/representation. The data was
            collected from physics experiments and needed to be interpreted for better understanding and future
            experiment design. Python and the pandas library were used for this analysis. I am willing and enthusiastic
            to learn new coding languages and frameworks.
