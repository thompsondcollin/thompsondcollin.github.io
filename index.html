            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I have a bachelor's in Mathematics and a minor in computer science and have just started my second semester
                in an online Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I am a fast learner and have a large drive to gain
                new skills and knowledge. In my undergraduate studies I was involved in two high level physics experiments
                on which I contributed greatly. This included data analysis and manipulation/representation. The data was
                collected from physics experiments and needed to be interpreted for better understanding and future
                experiment design. Python and the pandas library were used for this analysis. I am willing and enthusiastic
                to learn new coding languages and frameworks.

            <h2>Experience (Most Recent)</h2>
            <h3>Pyxeda instructor</h3>
            <p>
                Online computer science instuctor for K-12 students. This included teaching AI and general concepts in Pyhton 
                and Java.
            </p>
            <h3>Central Michigan University Summer Scholar Research Project</h3>
            <p>
                Analyzed data from a nuclear physics experiment under the direction of Dr. Estrade at the University of 
                Central Michigan. I then used this analysis to design 3D objects and find suitable equipment to be used in 
                the next expirments on the project.
            </p>
            <h3>McNair Scholars Program</h3>
            <p>
                As part of the 2019 Central Michigan University McNair Scholars Cohort I was able to conduct reaserch under the
                direction of Dr. Estrade. This is a national program designed to prepare first-generation and minority students 
                for graduate school. This research investigated nucleosynthesis of heavy elements by rapid neutron capture 
                process. I used the pandas module in a linux environment to produce data for computational nuclear physics experiments.
                These experiments were run with the use of Josh Lippuners's SkyNet: A modular nuclear reaction network library 
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1706.06198">(Lippuner adn Roberts, 2017)</a>.
